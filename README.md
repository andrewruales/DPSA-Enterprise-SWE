#In-Memory Key-Value Database with Transaction Support
Overview
This C++ program implements an in-memory key-value database with transaction support. The database provides basic functionalities such as get, put, begin_transaction, commit, and rollback. It ensures data consistency during transactions, preventing dirty writes.

Instructions
To run the code, follow these steps:

##1. Compile the Code:

*Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the in_memory_db.cpp file.
*Run the following command to compile the code (on macOS):
`g++ -o mycode in_memory_db.cpp`
*On Windows, use:
`g++ -o mycode.exe in_memory_db.cpp`

##2. Run the Executable:

*Execute the compiled program:
**On macOS:
`./mycode`
**On Windows:
`mycode.exe`

##3. Review Output:

*The program will display the results of the database operations based on the example usage in the main() function.

##Future Modifications

Enhanced Error Handling:
Improve error handling for edge cases and unexpected inputs to make the code more robust.

Documentation:
Expand comments and documentation within the code to provide clearer explanations of the implementation details.

Optimizations:
Explore opportunities for code optimizations and improvements in data structures to enhance performance.

Additional Features:
Consider adding more features to the database, such as support for different data types, indexing, or concurrent transactions.
